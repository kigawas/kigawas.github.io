Overview In modern JavaScript development, using some state container is a prevalent practice: redux for react and vuex for vue. But why it is necessary to integrate those &amp;ldquo;awesome state containers&amp;rdquo;? There might be too many reasons and they can be found in blogs all over the internet. In contrast, we&amp;rsquo;ll walk through the simplest scenario: states in module A have changed and module B needs to know and react.</description></item><item><title>Reconsider the performance benchmarks in Python web development</title><link>/posts/performance-benchmarks-in-python-web-development/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/performance-benchmarks-in-python-web-development/</guid><description>A few words on common misunderstandings and performance tips of web development benchmarks.
Overview As of 2020, amongst the various web benchmarks, the most prestigious and reliable one would be TechEmpower benchmarks. Despite the fact that asyncio-based web frameworks prevail on performance in theory and in practice, how performant those frameworks are in pragmatic environments remains to be inspected.
According to TechEmpower benchmarks, it can be noticed that some Python frameworks even outperform Gin, the most famous and widely used Go web framework.</description></item><item><title>The integration of FastAPI and Django ORM</title><link>/posts/integrate-fastapi-and-django-orm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/integrate-fastapi-and-django-orm/</guid><description>This is the English translation of the Japanese original post at qiita, with some modifications.
Motivation Recently FastAPI is growing incredibly. It&amp;rsquo;s blazingly fast and painless to develop, with 5~10x performance enhancement over Django or Flask.
I really want to switch to FastAPI from Django, however, it&amp;rsquo;s not that easy to give up Django and its self-sufficient user system as well as the admin page totally. I know it sounds greedy, but in fact there is such convenience.</description></item><item><title>Y-combinator in Python</title><link>/posts/y-combinator-in-python/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/y-combinator-in-python/</guid><description>A brief introduction to lambda calculus Lambda calculus is a language (formal system) to abstract and express calculation itself under only three concise rules.
