The Web Development Framework Dilemma In the dynamic world of web development, choosing the right language and framework often feels like solving a Rubik&amp;rsquo;s cube blindfolded. As developers, we frequently find ourselves balancing competing priorities: performance vs. development speed, flexibility vs. structure, scalability vs. ease of use.
Selecting a web development framework is a multifaceted challenge, whose dilemma often leads to compromises.</description></item><item><title>Reconsider the performance benchmarks in Python web development</title><link>/posts/performance-benchmarks-in-python-web-development/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/performance-benchmarks-in-python-web-development/</guid><description>A few words on common misunderstandings and performance tips of web development benchmarks.
Overview As of 2020, amongst the various web benchmarks, the most prestigious and reliable one would be TechEmpower benchmarks. Despite the fact that asyncio-based web frameworks prevail on performance in theory and in practice, how performant those frameworks are in pragmatic environments remains to be inspected.
According to TechEmpower benchmarks, it can be noticed that some Python frameworks even outperform Gin, the most famous and widely used Go web framework.</description></item><item><title>The integration of FastAPI and Django ORM</title><link>/posts/integrate-fastapi-and-django-orm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/integrate-fastapi-and-django-orm/</guid><description>This is the English translation of the Japanese original post at qiita, with some modifications.
